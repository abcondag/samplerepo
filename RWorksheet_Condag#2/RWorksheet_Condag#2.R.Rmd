```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
1. Create a vector using : operator


  a. Sequence from -5 to 5.
```{r}
seq1 <- -5:5
seq1
```
The output is a sequence of number from negative 5 to positive 5.
       
  b. x <- 1:7.
```{r}
x <- 1:7
x
```
  What will be the value of x?
  
       The value of x would be a sequence of numbers from 1 to 7.
       
2. Create a vector using seq() function


  a. seq(1, 3, by=0.2) specify step size
```{r}
seq2 <- seq(1, 3, by = 0.2)
seq2
```
The values between 1 and 3 are generated with each next value being 0.2 greater than the previous one.
